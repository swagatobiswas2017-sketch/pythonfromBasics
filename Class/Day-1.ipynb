    "## Types of Loops in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **for loop**\n",
    "- Used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, string, range, etc.)\n",
    "- Executes a fixed number of times (determined by the sequence length)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **while loop**\n",
    "- Repeats as long as a condition is True\n",
    "- Useful when we don't know in advance how many iterations we need\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Control Statements:\n",
    "- `break`: Exit the loop entirely\n",
    "- `continue`: Skip to the next iteration\n",
    "- `pass`: Do nothing (placeholder)"
